/**
 * engineProviderSession.ts — T-915 (ADR-037/B-ENG) pure-storage helpers.
 *
 * Extracted from useChatProviderState.ts so they can be:
 *   a) imported by useChatRealtimeHandlers.ts without pulling in React, and
 *   b) unit-tested in node:test without browser/React stubs.
 *
 * Three orthogonal storage slots:
 *
 *   1. GLOBAL key  (`claude-engine-provider`)           — user's current picker choice.
 *      Written by persistEngineProvider; read on app boot.
 *
 *   2. SESSION key (`claude-engine-provider-<sessionId}`) — engine stamped when the
 *      session was CREATED (the value actually sent in the claude-command).
 *      Written by stampSessionEngineProvider, read by readSessionEngineProvider.
 *
 *   3. PENDING slot (sessionStorage `__nassaj_pending_engine_stamp`) — one-shot
 *      handoff between dispatchProviderCommand (send time) and the session_created
 *      handler (stamp time). Written by writePendingEngineStamp, consumed+cleared
 *      by consumePendingEngineStamp.  Prevents the global key (slot 1) from being
 *      read at stamp time, which would leak a stale selection into a new session
 *      whose React state had been reset to null when opening an older session.
