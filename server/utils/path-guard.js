/**
 * Symlink-aware path boundary guard for project file access (B-159 / T-845).
 *
 * The pre-existing checks in the file endpoints resolved a client-supplied path
 * with `path.resolve` and then compared it against the project root with
 * `String.startsWith`. That comparison is purely LEXICAL: it never follows
 * symbolic links. A symlink planted inside the project tree (e.g. shipped inside
 * a cloned git repository) that points OUTSIDE the tree therefore passed the
 * check, yet `createReadStream`/`readFile`/`writeFile` would follow the link and
 * touch an arbitrary path on disk — arbitrary file disclosure on the read paths
 * and arbitrary write/delete on the mutate paths.
 *
 * These helpers add the missing canonicalization step (`fs.realpath`) so the
 * boundary is enforced against the REAL on-disk location, not the lexical string.
 * They are the single shared implementation every file path calls, so the guard
 * cannot drift between endpoints.
 *
 * Depends only on node:path + node:fs (no server/express/DB coupling), so it is
 * unit-testable against a real temp-dir filesystem.

/**
 * Canonicalize a client-supplied path against a project root and confirm — after
 * following symlinks — that it stays strictly inside the tree. For READ endpoints
 * that then open the file (createReadStream / readFile), so the target must exist.
 *
 * Two layered checks:
 *   1. Lexical fast-reject (path.resolve + startsWith). Catches obvious "../.."
 *      traversal without any filesystem I/O.
 *   2. Canonical boundary (fs.realpath on BOTH the target and the root, then
 *      re-check startsWith). Catches a symlink inside the tree pointing outside.
 *
 * Callers MUST open the returned `realResolved` (the canonical, verified path) —
 * not the lexical `resolved` — so a symlink cannot be swapped between the check
 * and the open (TOCTOU).
 *
 * @param {string} projectRoot     Absolute project root directory.
 * @param {string} requestedPath   Client-supplied path (absolute or project-relative).
 * @returns {Promise<
 *   { valid: true, resolved: string, realResolved: string } |
