/**
 * Graceful shutdown drain — B-N-DRAIN (ADR-021 / ADR-022), reworked for B-23.
 *
 * A stop signal (SIGINT/SIGTERM — PM2 sends SIGINT in fork mode) triggers a
 * TIMED DRAIN instead of an immediate process.exit(0). In-flight provider runs
 * (claude/agy/codex/...) are child processes that die with this process, so we
 * wait — bounded by drainTimeoutMs — for active sessions to finish before
 * exiting.
 *
 * B-23 fix (2026-06-11): the original drain kept the HTTP/WS listener bound
 * for the whole drain, so the PM2 replacement instance crash-looped on
 * EADDRINUSE (10x in ~5s -> "errored") and the service collapsed once the old
 * instance finally exited. The drain now RELEASES THE PORT IMMEDIATELY on the
 * first stop signal:
 *
 *   1. `server.close()` — closes the listening socket synchronously (the port
 *      is free for the replacement instance) while established sockets keep
 *      working.
 *   2. Every WebSocket client is closed with 1001 (going away) so UIs
 *      reconnect to the replacement instance and resume from the
 *      registry/transcript (PHASE-SR-0) instead of feeding new work to the
 *      draining process.
 *   3. `server.closeIdleConnections()` — drops idle keep-alive sockets so
 *      lingering HTTP clients cannot route new requests to the old code.
 *
 * Child provider processes are NOT touched: they keep running until their
 * sessions finish (the whole point of the drain), and PM2 must keep
 * `treekill: false` so its eventual SIGKILL never propagates to them.
 *
 * drainTimeoutMs = 0 (the default) waits WITHOUT a deadline — owner decision
 * B-N-DRAIN (2026-06-09): "drain with no ceiling, roles may run for hours". The
 * EADDRINUSE crash-loop that motivated B-41 was NOT caused by the unbounded
 * drain: the T-95 diagnosis proved the predecessor held the port because it had
 * never received a stop signal (PM2 fork-mode lost its pid under treekill:false,
 * ADR-028/B-24), not because the drain deliberately kept the listener open
 * (B-23 already releases it on the first stop signal). The loop is broken by the
 * listen guard (listen-with-guard.service.ts), which makes a starting instance
 * tolerate a held port instead of crash-looping — so no time cap on the drain is
 * needed. The escape hatches for a genuinely wedged drain remain: a second stop
 * signal (immediate exit) and PM2's kill_timeout.
