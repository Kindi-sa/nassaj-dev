/**
 * Docker-socket boot guard (T-896 / B-170) — fail-closed, NO disable flag
 * (committee decision 2026-07-14, qa-critic veto on any escape hatch).
 *
 * Threat: the shared `nassaj` uid holding the docker group makes every AI
 * provider one `docker run -v /:/host` away from host root — a cage/sandbox
 * around a process that can reach docker.sock is "a jail with its key in the
 * prisoner's pocket". The host fix is degrouping (`gpasswd -d nassaj docker`),
 * but a pm2 God-daemon born BEFORE the degroup keeps the stale group and
 * re-inherits it into every restarted app (observed live 2026-07-14). This
 * guard makes that state unbootable: if the server process can reach
 * /var/run/docker.sock via its gids, refuse to serve at all.
 *
 * Check (numeric-only, per the adversarial review of T-896): stat the socket
 * and compare its OWNING GID as a NUMBER against the process's gids. Matching
 * by group NAME is forbidden — `groupdel docker` leaves the socket owned by
 * the raw gid (e.g. 989) with no name, which a name check would wave through.
 *
 * Outcomes:
 *   - socket absent (ENOENT/ENOTDIR)      → silent pass (nothing to escape to);
 *   - socket present, gid NOT held        → pass (logs one info line);
 *   - socket present, gid held            → operational fatal error with the
 *     exact degroup remediation steps, then DockerSockExposedError
 *     (startServer's catch exits 1 before the listener ever opens);
 *   - cannot determine (stat error other than absence, or a platform without
 *     getgroups while the socket exists) → FAIL CLOSED: same fatal path, but
 *     with its OWN diagnostic message (qa-critic 2026-07-14: the degroup
 *     steps are wrong medicine for a stat failure and would mislead the
 *     operator). An unverifiable boot is treated as an exposed boot, never
 *     waved through.
 *
 * DELIBERATE fail-closed trade-off on unexpected errno (documented per the
 * 2026-07-14 review): a host-filesystem fault that makes the socket
 * unstat-able (EACCES on /var/run, EIO, ELOOP from a tampered symlink chain…)
 * refuses boot on a node that might factually be safe — including production
 * traventure. That cost is accepted BY DESIGN: this guard protects against
 * root escape, and "cannot verify" is indistinguishable at boot time from
 * "exposed and hidden". Availability is recoverable by an operator fixing the
 * host FS; a silent waved-through root escape is not. The unverifiable
 * message spells out that distinction so the on-call operator debugs the
 * host, not the group membership.
 *
 * Residual (documented, out of this guard's mandate): a process running as
 * uid 0, or a setfacl ACL granting the uid direct socket access, bypasses the
 * gid check. Neither applies to the nassaj service model (non-root uid, no
 * ACLs); tracked in the T-896 spike report.
