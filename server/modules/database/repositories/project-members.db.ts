/**
 * Project members repository (B-PRIV).
 *
 * Backs explicit membership of a project (table: project_members). A private
 * project is visible only to its creator (projects.created_by), the users listed
 * here, and users derived from session participation. By owner decision privacy
 * is ABSOLUTE: there is no platform-owner bypass at the visibility layer — the
 * platform owner sees a private project only if they are themselves a member.
 *
 * role: 'owner' (may manage visibility + membership) | 'member' (read access).
 * All access uses prepared statements — no string interpolation of caller input.
