/**
 * ADR-048 — Workflow Completion Reconcile (incident 2026-06-27, wf_ef5ba242-b4b).
 *
 * THE BUG THIS CORRECTS (visibility desync, NOT work loss): a background
 * `Workflow` run is launched from a Claude session via the Agent SDK. On a
 * server `restart`, `treekill:false` (B-N-DRAIN) keeps the workflow's subagents
 * alive as orphans — they finish and write their `result` rows into
 * `<sessionDir>/subagents/workflows/wf_<id>/journal.jsonl`. But the drain count
 * (`countActiveSessionsByProvider`) only sees in-memory provider sessions, never
 * workflows, so the parent process exits immediately and the replacement process
 * emits a `run.stopped` task-notification (truthful at its timestamp, but
 * earlier than the real completion) with no later correction path. The work
 * lands on disk while the UI shows "stopped".
 *
 * The root cause lives in the Claude Code SDK layer (no workflow-completion
 * tracking across restart). nassaj cannot patch the SDK; it reconciles in its
 * own layer by READING the on-disk trace the SDK leaves behind (journal.jsonl).
 *
 * C5 — SETTLED STATE (incident wf_ef5ba242-b4b, 16 started / 15 result):
 * the original completeness gate required `startedKeys ⊆ resultKeys` (every
 * started work item produced a result). That mis-classified the COMMON orphan
 * shape — a workflow that produced real output but left one subagent hanging at
 * restart, so one `started` key never gained its `result` row — as "not
 * complete", and the stopped notification was never corrected (the incident:
 * 16/15 across that journal, 346/318 across all journals). The classifier now
 * distinguishes two correctable terminal states from the un-correctable null:
 *   - 'completed' — startedKeys⊆resultKeys (agentsDone == agentsTotal). [as before]
 *   - 'settled'   — startedKeys⊄resultKeys but resultKeys.size≥1, the journal is
 *                   quiet, and its mtime is past the stopped row: real work
 *                   landed yet a subagent stayed hanging (agentsDone < agentsTotal).
 *   - null        — resultKeys.size==0, or not quiet, or mtime≤stopped: no signal.
 * The freshness gates (quiet window + mtime > stopped) still apply to BOTH
 * correctable states, so a still-writing orphan is never prematurely declared
 * settled mid-flight.
 *
 * DESIGN CONSTRAINTS (ADR-048):
 * - Read-only. Never writes the SDK-owned transcript and never touches the
 *   drain / B-N-DRAIN / shutdown-drain path.
 * - Fail-safe: any anomaly (missing folder, malformed line, unknown shape, stat
 *   failure, empty result set) yields NO correction, never throws, logs only
 *   via console.debug. The caller continues with its original payload as if this
 *   service did not exist (mirrors transcript-parser's "never throws on bad
 *   input" contract).
 * - Behind the `WORKFLOW_RECONCILE` flag (default OFF) so the byte-for-byte
 *   prior behaviour is preserved when disabled and the coupling to the internal
 *   journal.jsonl shape (which an upstream upgrade may change) is isolated.
 * - The correction is a DERIVED synthetic message appended to the
 *   getSessionMessages payload — not persisted — so disabling the flag removes
 *   it without a trace.
